# Open resources of interest for testing and further development

Any contribution and participation welcome! I am happy to connect and perhaps even help with resources, parts and funding! Comment here or write to tobias.wenzel@embl.de

## Selected promising resources

### Open syringepump(s)
http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_syringe_pump
http://www.appropedia.org/Lynch_open_source_syringe_pump_modifications

### Open pressure controll (alternative to syringe pumps)

My own project, to be extended and tested: https://www.docubricks.com/viewer.jsp?id=6067044959053384704
A useful manifold for quake-style valves, to be tested soon: https://metafluidics.org/devices/32-channel-controller/

### Open digital microscopy

Open Flexure Microscope

### Open Dropseq station

After looking at the details of the project, this seems like a fantastic piece of hardware and documentation. We will definitely try to build it. Nice small and low-cost solutions for pressure controll.

### Open fast-imaging solutions

None are konwn to us so far! Please let me know. Fast-responding cameras would be great or stroboscopic illumination for droplet microfluidics

I believe that stroboscopic imaging has already been build by many labs. Who would be interested to publish the designs openly?
