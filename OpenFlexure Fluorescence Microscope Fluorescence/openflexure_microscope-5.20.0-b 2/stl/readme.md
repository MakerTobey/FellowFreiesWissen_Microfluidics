# OpenFlexure Microscope STL Files
tl;dr **don't print these files if you want a microscope!** You should either go to the [documentation](../docs/) or the automatically built files in [builds](../builds/) (see the readme there for details of how to pick the right files to print).  You can also clone the repository and build it yourself if you have ``make`` and ``openscad``.  Bear in mind that these STL files might not perfectly match the instructions, as they get improved faster than the photos can be re-taken!

This folder is for STL files that have been compiled outside of the usual build process.  It's possible I should have excluded these from the repo, as they are build products - but it's often handy to have them here.  I will probably get rid of this folder in the future.  *Please don't just print this folder* as it does not add up to a full microscope!
