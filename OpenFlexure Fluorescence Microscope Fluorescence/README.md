This is a fork of the [OpenFlexure Microscope](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope) pre-release [beta 5.20](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/releases/tag/v5.20.0-b).
The [corresponding build instructions live here](http://rwb27.github.io/openflexure_microscope/docs/).

In this repository, the design is beeing modified for fluorescence application and additional photosensors for FADS.
The official [discussion on a fluorescence version of the OpenFlexure Microscope takes place here](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/issues/43).
Relevant [illumination parts (Kohler illumination, condenser) are discussed here](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/issues/77).
