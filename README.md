# FellowFreiesWissen_Microfluidics

This GitHub repository is an in-progress collection of Open Source Hardware instrumentation for microfluidic research, as well as an assessment of the openess of the field in general. This is a community driven effort and **you are invited to contribute thoughts, content, comments and help testing the instrumentation**! 

This projekt is run as part of my current Fellowship Freies Wissen (translates to Open Knowledge), here is the [lproject description on the corresponding Wikiversity page!](https://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Fellow-Programm_Freies_Wissen/Einreichungen/Open_labware_for_better_life_science) and see the file Roadmap.md.

## The following two aims are addressed in this repository:

* A review outline that collects information on the openess of the research field, its instrumentation and reagents. **Please comment by submitting issues on GitHub or contact me directly** if you want to be part of the more concentrated writing effort: Tobias.Wenzel /at/ embl.de

* A list of microfluidics relevant Open Source Harwdare instrumentation, connected to the practical aim of testing the documentations by reading them carefully, by building the instrumentation in some cases (remotely and Heidelberg based workshop in early 2019) and further by testing, comparing and calibrating the equipement. **Everyone is welcome to contribute**.  Please contact me directly (Tobias.Wenzel /at/ embl.de) if you need financial help with hardware parts in oder to test the documentations and redocument them on [DocuBricks!](docurbricks.com) to create more accessible, open hardware standard documentations.

### Happy contributing!
