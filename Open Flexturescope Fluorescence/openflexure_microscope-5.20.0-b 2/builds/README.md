OpenFlexure Microscope: STL files
=================================

This folder contains the printable files you'll need in order to make an OpenFlexure microscope.  It is our intention that in the near future this folder will move to a proper build server, and stop cluttering up the repository.  It is important to note that **YOU SHOULD NOT JUST PRINT ALL THE FILES IN THIS FOLDER**.  Please read the printing instructions in the [documentation](../docs/) first.
