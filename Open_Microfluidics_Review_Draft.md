## Openess of microfluidics research & developement and ways forward

Increasing openess can be acheived in many different ways, such as increased accessibility of techniques or results to a professional or general audience, greater ease of use, increased mobility of researchers of different seniority, discipines or ethnicity into the field.
One aspect that enjoys recent popularity in microfluidic and bioprocess technologies is the "biohacker"or Do-It-Yourself (DIY) biology movement. The later includes self-made and low-cost research instrumentation.
Such advances in openess greatly improve the accessibility of microfluidic and related technology to lay people and have been reviewed recently [akerspaces." Trends in Biotechnology (February 3, 2017). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.01.001].
The open source hardware originating from this context does usually not, however, fulfill key application relevant criteria such as basic safety mechanisms (e.g. dremel fuge), bencharking calibration assessment (e.g. XXX), and documentation best practices as reccomended by the GOSH community [e.g. https://www.docubricks.com/best-practise-guide.jsp] or the Journal of Open Hardware, OSWA, etc.
In this review we threrefore forcus on hardware and manufacturing related aspects of microfluidic and related technology for professional ( in particular academic) applications.
(i) Open access publications compared to similar fields or technologies, Accessibility of information, Patenting, level of opneess in project aim/idea exchange (e.g. conferences, applications, etc)
(ii) Availablility of instructions, designs, details of method sections
(iii) control of resources by labs, equipement and reagent transparency and modifyability, use of open platforms and software.
(iv) digitalisation and digital manufacturing publications and chalenges
(v) identification of potentially valualble resources for microfluidic research drawing on digital manufacturing, open source and publis resources.
- high quality small-scale fluidic chip manufacturing techniques
- imaging of droplets (normal, fhigh-speed (e.g. stroboscopic+software), fluorescence)
- sorting of droplets (hardware-fast-processing, software, instructions)
- pressure control
- simlation tools
- open reagents
